# sharc
Compiler for the Shar programming language.

To install, download the archive with the installer (sharc-installer-*.tar.zst), unpack and run the "./install.sh" file.  
Installation may take some time due to AOT compilation.  
The installer copies files to system directories, so superuser privileges are requested during installation.  
To install, you need clang version 12 or higher, and to compile programs on Shar, you will need llvm (opt utility) version 12 or higher.
